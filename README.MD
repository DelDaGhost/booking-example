# Booking Example

This is a monorepo for a hotel booking application.

## Project structure

- `backend/`: Laravel-based GraphQL API providing room and booking data\
    This is coded entirely by myself without the help of AI in order to show my current skills as Backend-Developer
- `frontend/`: React frontend built with Vite and Tailwind CSS\
    This is coded entirely by CHATGPT and without any knowledge of React itself in order to show my learning curve in your workflow. 
- `docker/`: Docker Compose setup for backend/frontend

All services are designed to work together using Docker.
